# FutBot Activity — Build Progress

## Overview

A Discord Activity (embedded iframe web app) for the FutBot Discord bot. Phase 1 is fully standalone — shares `cards_game.db` with the bot but has its own API server and drop logic. Phase 2 (future) will integrate directly with the bot.

**Primary feature:** Real-time 1v1 card battles.

## Features Built

### Auth
- Discord OAuth2 via Embedded App SDK
- Token exchanged server-side (`POST /api/token`)
- Token verification cached for 5 minutes (avoids hitting Discord API on every request)
- New players auto-created in `players` table on first `/api/me` call

### Home Page
- Custom layout (not using global bottom nav)
- **Top bar:** FutBot logo, coin balance, profile pill (clickable)
- **Three panels:** Packs, Play Match (gold border, pulsing CTA), Decks — each using provided PNG as full background
- **Bottom nav:** HOME, COLLECTION, SHOP, PACKS, DECKS, BATTLE with gold active state + glow underline
- **Online chip:** shows stacked avatars of VC participants, clickable to open OnlinePanel popup
- Stadium `background.png` shows through all panels with dark overlay
- Ember particle animations (floating gold dots)

### Collection Browser
- Grid view, cards sorted by overall DESC
- Filter by Rarity, Position, Type
- Click card → modal with OVR (large), ATK/DEF/SPD stats
- Lazy loading on grid images, eager loading where immediate display needed

### Deck Builder
- List decks with mini card strip preview
- Editor: 5 slots at top (fixed 125px wide, crop to show card face), inventory grid below
- Filters by position and rarity in editor
- Create / Update / Delete decks

### Pack Opening
- Shows only packs you own (hides empty types)
- 3D card flip animation (face-down → flip to reveal)
- All card images preloaded before animation starts
- Card-by-card reveal with stats, then summary grid

**Pack types:**
| Pack | Contents | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| Rare Player Pack | 1 card, 80% Standard >85 OVR / 20% non-Standard >85 OVR | 1,000 coins |
| Icon Pack | 1 Icon card | 2,500 coins |
| Hero Pack | 1 Hero card | 1,750 coins |
| Tester Pack | 1 Icon + 4 high-overall cards (not buyable) | — |

**Starter Pack (new users):** 6 Common (70-79 OVR) + 3 Uncommon (80-85 OVR) + 1 Rare Standard (>85 OVR). Claimed once on first activity open, then user is redirected to Deck Builder.

### Shop
- **Buy Packs tab:** shows affordable packs, coin balance, buy with coins
- **Sell Cards tab:** collection grid with sell value shown, tap → confirm sheet
- Sell value formula (matches bot): Base (100/175/250) + 50 + (overall-70)×5

### Profile Modal
- Opens by clicking profile pill in home top bar
- Slide-in panel from right
- Shows: avatar, username, current title, coins
- Battle stats: Played, Won, Lost, Drawn, Win Rate
- Round stats: Played, Won, Lost, Drawn
- Card collection: Total, Common, Uncommon, Rare counts
- **Title selector:** chips for each earned achievement title, save updates top bar instantly

### Battle System

**Lobby modes (from Home → Find Match or Play with Friend):**
- **Find Match:** shows VC participants with Challenge buttons; "Create Room" fallback
- **Play with Friend:** Create Room & Share Code, or Join with code input

**Flow:**
1. Both players connect to room (no deck needed yet)
2. Both see "Select Your Squad" deck selection screen in the arena
3. If opponent selects first → green "✓ ready" banner appears
4. Both send `ready` → VS splash (2.2s) → game starts

**Battle mechanic:**
- 5 rounds, best of 3 wins (first to 3 round wins wins the match)
- Odd rounds: host picks stat | Even rounds: guest picks stat (alternates)
- Stat pairs: Attack ↔ Defense (attacker's ATK vs defender's DEF), Speed ↔ Speed
- Tiebreaker if stat values equal: higher overall wins; if still equal → round draw
- 4 second delay between rounds (auto-advance)

**Surrender:** Two-step in-bar confirmation (Surrender → "Sure? Yes / No"), no browser dialog

**Rematch:** Both click Rematch → goes back to deck selection (can switch decks)

**Rewards (match end):**
- Win: +200 coins, `battles_played+1`, `battles_won+1`
- Loss: +100 coins, `battles_played+1`, `battles_lost+1`
- Draw: +150 coins each, `battles_played+1`, `battles_drawn+1`

**Round stats (every round):**
- Both: `rounds_played+1`
- Winner: `rounds_won+1` | Loser: `rounds_lost+1` | True draw: both `rounds_drawn+1`

### Challenge System
- **Online chip:** clickable on all pages → OnlinePanel popup showing VC participants with Challenge buttons
- **Challenging:** sends `POST /api/challenges` with room_id, challenger connects to room and waits
- **Accepting (notification):** global `ChallengeNotification` banner appears on any page → click Accept → "Enter the Arena" screen with deck selector → connects to room
- **Accepting (Battle page):** same Arena screen shown
- **Declining:** sends `challenge_declined` WebSocket message to inviter → they see message and return to lobby
- Challenge TTL: 60 seconds

### Online/Presence System
- Lobby registration: `POST /api/lobby/register` called every 30s with channel_id
- Participants: `GET /api/lobby/participants` returns others in same VC session with avatar hashes
- Stacked avatar display in online chip across all pages

## Key Design Decisions

- **No deck selection in lobby** — deck is picked inside the arena after both players connect, making the challenge flow frictionless
- **Pack drop logic is standalone** — replicated from bot.py weights but independent; will be reconciled in Phase 2
- **Token verification cached** — Discord API is hit once per 5 minutes per token to avoid latency on every request
- **Images preloaded before animations** — pack flip and battle reveal wait for images to load before playing
- **Material Symbols self-hosted** — Discord Activity CSP blocks Google Fonts CDN; font served from local `node_modules/material-symbols/`
- **No lazy loading in battle** — `loading="lazy"` removed from battle card images since they need to appear immediately

---

## Local Dev Setup

```bash
# Terminal 1 — tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd activity/frontend && npm run dev

# Terminal 3 — backend
cd activity/backend && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Vite proxies `/api`, `/ws`, and `/images` to FastAPI locally.

---

## What Phase 2 Will Change

- Replace `cards_game.db` backup with the live bot DB
- Extract pack drop logic into a shared module
- Bot commands trigger activity experiences (e.g. `!open` → pack opening animation)
- Bot deep-links to the activity
- Possibly migrate to PostgreSQL if concurrency becomes an issue
